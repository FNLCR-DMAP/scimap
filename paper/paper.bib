We used multiplexed imaging, quantitative spatial analysis, and machine learning to create high-definition maps of lung tumors from a Kras/Trp53-mutant mouse model and human resections. Networks of interacting lymphocytes ("lymphonets") emerged as a distinctive feature of the anti-cancer immune response. Lymphonets nucleated from small T cell clusters and incorporated B cells with increasing size. {CXCR}3-mediated trafficking modulated lymphonet size and number, but T cell antigen expression directed intratumoral localization. Lymphonets preferentially harbored {TCF}1+ {PD}-1+ progenitor {CD}8+ T cells involved in responses to immune checkpoint blockade ({ICB}) therapy. Upon treatment of mice with {ICB} or an antigen-targeted vaccine, lymphonets retained progenitor and gained cytotoxic {CD}8+ T cell populations, likely via progenitor differentiation. These data show that lymphonets create a spatial environment supportive of {CD}8+ T cell anti-tumor responses.},

	abstract = {Cutaneous melanoma is a highly immunogenic malignancy that is surgically curable at early stages but life-threatening when metastatic. Here we integrate high-plex imaging, 3D high-resolution microscopy, and spatially resolved microregion transcriptomics to study immune evasion and immunoediting in primary melanoma. We find that recurrent cellular neighborhoods involving tumor, immune, and stromal cells change significantly along a progression axis involving precursor states, melanoma in situ, and invasive tumor. Hallmarks of immunosuppression are already detectable in precursor regions. When tumors become locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted suppressive environment forms along the tumor–stromal boundary. This environment is established by cytokine gradients that promote expression of {MHC}-{II} and {IDO}1, and by {PD}1–{PDL}1-mediated cell contacts involving macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells. A few millimeters away, cytotoxic T cells synapse with melanoma cells in fields of tumor regression. Thus, invasion and immunoediting can coexist within a few millimeters of each other in a single specimen.The reorganization of the tumor ecosystem in primary melanoma is an excellent setting in which to study immunoediting and immune evasion. Guided by classic histopathology, spatial profiling of proteins and {mRNA} reveals recurrent morphologic and molecular features of tumor evolution that involve localized paracrine cytokine signaling and direct cell–cell contact.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1397},

	abstract = {Tissue homeostasis and the emergence of disease are controlled by changes in the proportions of resident and recruited cells, their organization into cellular neighbourhoods, and their interactions with acellular tissue components. Highly multiplexed tissue profiling (spatial omics) makes it possible to study this microenvironment in situ, usually in 4-5 micron thick sections (the standard histopathology format). Microscopy-based tissue profiling is commonly performed at a resolution sufficient to determine cell types but not to detect subtle morphological features associated with cytoskeletal reorganisation, juxtracrine signalling, or membrane trafficking. Here we describe a high-resolution 3D imaging approach able to characterize a wide variety of organelles and structures at sub-micron scale while simultaneously quantifying millimetre-scale spatial features. This approach combines cyclic immunofluorescence ({CyCIF}) imaging of over 50 markers with confocal microscopy of archival human tissue thick enough (30-40 microns) to fully encompass two or more layers of intact cells. 3D imaging of entire cell volumes substantially improves the accuracy of cell phenotyping and allows cell proximity to be scored using plasma membrane apposition, not just nuclear position. In pre-invasive melanoma in situ, precise phenotyping shows that adjacent melanocytic cells are plastic in state and participate in tightly localised niches of interferon signalling near sites of initial invasion into the underlying dermis. In this and metastatic melanoma, mature and precursor T cells engage in an unexpectedly diverse array of juxtracrine and membrane-membrane interactions as well as looser neighbourhood associations whose morphologies reveal functional states. These data provide new insight into the transitions occurring during early tumour formation and immunoediting and demonstrate the potential for phenotyping of tissues at a level of detail previously restricted to cultured cells and organoids.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the language model Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}), which clusters co-occurring words into topics, has been widely appled in the computer vision field. However, many of these applications have difficulty with modeling the spatial and temporal structure among visual words, since {LDA} assumes that a document is a bag-of-words''. It is also critical to properly designwords'' and “documents” when using a language model to solve vision problems. In this paper, we propose a topic model Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({SLDA}), which better encodes spatial structure among visual words that are essential for solving many vision problems. The spatial information is not encoded in the value of visual words but in the design of documents. Instead of knowing the partition of words into documents {\textbackslash}textit\{a priori\}, the word-document assignment becomes a random hidden variable in {SLDA}. There is a generative procedure, where knowledge of spatial structure can be flexibly added as a prior, grouping visual words which are close in space into the same document. We use {SLDA} to discover objects from a collection of images, and show it achieves better performance than {LDA}.},

This is challenging due to the difficulty of accurately assigning boundaries between cells (segmentation) and then generating per-cell staining intensities. Existing methods use gating to convert per-cell intensity data to positive and negative scores; this is a common approach in flow cytometry, but one that is problematic in imaging. In contrast, human experts identify cells in crowded environments using morphological, neighborhood, and intensity information. Here we describe a computational approach (Cell Spotter or {CSPOT}) that uses supervised machine learning in combination with classical segmentation to perform automated cell type calling. {CSPOT} is robust to artifacts that commonly afflict tissue imaging and can replace conventional gating. The end-to-end Python implementation of {CSPOT} can be integrated into cloud-based image processing pipelines to substantially improve the speed, accuracy, and reproducibility of single-cell spatial data.},

Study of these assemblies has advanced dramatically with the introduction of high-plex spatial profiling. Image-based profiling methods reveal the intensities and spatial distributions of 20-100 proteins at subcellular resolution in 103–107 cells per specimen. Despite extensive work on methods for extracting single-cell data from these images, all tissue images contain artefacts such as folds, debris, antibody aggregates, optical aberrations and image processing errors that arise from imperfections in specimen preparation, data acquisition, image assembly, and feature extraction. We show that these artefacts dramatically impact single-cell data analysis, obscuring meaningful biological interpretation. We describe an interactive quality control software tool, {CyLinter}, that identifies and removes data associated with imaging artefacts. {CyLinter} greatly improves single-cell analysis, especially for archival specimens sectioned many years prior to data collection, such as those from clinical trials.},

Accurate computational registration of sequential images is achieved by aligning nuclear counterstain-derived fiducial points. Individual cells, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, tumor, and stromal regions are segmented to achieve cellular and subcellular quantification of multiplexed targets. In a comparison of pathologist scoring of diaminobenzidine staining of serial sections and automated {MxIF} scoring of a single section, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, p53, and androgen receptor staining by diaminobenzidine and {MxIF} methods yielded similar results. Single-cell staining patterns of 61 protein antigens by {MxIF} in 747 colorectal cancer subjects reveals extensive tumor heterogeneity, and cluster analysis of divergent signaling through {ERK}1/2, S6 kinase 1, and 4E binding protein 1 provides insights into the spatial organization of mechanistic target of rapamycin and {MAPK} signal transduction. Our results suggest {MxIF} should be broadly applicable to problems in the fields of basic biological research, drug discovery and development, and clinical diagnostics.},

	url = {https://zenodo.org/records/8115575},
	shorttitle = {napari},
	abstract = {napari 0.4.18
We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.4.18!
napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the {GUI}), vispy (for performant {GPU}-based
rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

This is primarily a bug-fix release, addressing many issues from 0.4.17 (see
"Bug Fixes", below). However, it also contains some performance improvements and
several exciting new features (see "Highlights"), so read on below!

For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website:

https://napari.org
Highlights



Drawing polygons in the Shapes layer can now be done much faster with
the new lasso tool (napari/napari/\#5555)

Surface layers now support textures and vertex colors, allowing a whole new
type of dataset to be visualised in napari. Have a look at
surface\_multi\_texture.py and surface\_texture\_and\_colors.py in the
examples directory for some pretty demos! (napari/napari/\#5642)

Previously, navigating an image required switching out of whatever drawing
mode you might have been using and going back to pan/zoom mode. Now you can use
the mouse wheel to zoom in and out in any mode. (napari/napari/\#5701)

Painting labels is now much, much faster (achieving 60fps even on an 8k x 8k
image) (napari/napari/\#5723 and
napari/napari/\#5732)

Vectors layers can now be displayed with two different styles of arrowheads,
instead of just plain lines. This removes a longstanding limitation of the
vectors layer! (napari/napari/\#5740)
