	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Human and animal tissues consist of heterogeneous cell types that organize and interact in highly structured manners. Bulk and single-cell sequencing technologies remove cells from their original microenvironments, resulting in a loss of spatial information. Spatial transcriptomics is a recent technological innovation that measures transcriptomic information while preserving spatial information. Spatial transcriptomic data can be generated in several ways. {RNA} molecules are measured by {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in situ{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} sequencing, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in situ{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} hybridization, or spatial barcoding to recover original spatial coordinates. The inclusion of spatial information expands the range of possibilities for analysis and visualization, and spurred the development of numerous novel methods. In this review, we summarize the core concepts of spatial genomics technology and provide a comprehensive review of current analysis and visualization methods for spatial transcriptomics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Limitations on the number of unique protein and {DNA} molecules that can be characterized microscopically in a single tissue specimen impede advances in understanding the biological basis of health and disease. Here we present a multiplexed fluorescence microscopy method ({MxIF}) for quantitative, single-cell, and subcellular characterization of multiple analytes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Chemical inactivation of fluorescent dyes after each image acquisition round allows reuse of common dyes in iterative staining and imaging cycles. The mild inactivation chemistry is compatible with total and phosphoprotein detection, as well as {DNA} {FISH}. Accurate computational registration of sequential images is achieved by aligning nuclear counterstain-derived fiducial points. Individual cells, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, tumor, and stromal regions are segmented to achieve cellular and subcellular quantification of multiplexed targets. In a comparison of pathologist scoring of diaminobenzidine staining of serial sections and automated {MxIF} scoring of a single section, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, p53, and androgen receptor staining by diaminobenzidine and {MxIF} methods yielded similar results. Single-cell staining patterns of 61 protein antigens by {MxIF} in 747 colorectal cancer subjects reveals extensive tumor heterogeneity, and cluster analysis of divergent signaling through {ERK}1/2, S6 kinase 1, and 4E binding protein 1 provides insights into the spatial organization of mechanistic target of rapamycin and {MAPK} signal transduction.

An algorithmic pipeline for single-cell antigen quantification in tightly packed tissues was developed and used to overlay well-known morphological features with de novo characterization of lymphoid tissue architecture at a single-cell and cellular neighborhood levels. We observed an unexpected, profound impact of the cellular neighborhood on the expression of protein receptors on immune cells. By comparing normal murine spleen to spleens from animals with systemic autoimmune disease ({MRL}/lpr), extensive and previously uncharacterized splenic cell-interaction dynamics in the healthy versus diseased state was observed.

Despite extensive work on methods for extracting single-cell data from these images, all tissue images contain artefacts such as folds, debris, antibody aggregates, optical aberrations and image processing errors that arise from imperfections in specimen preparation, data acquisition, image assembly, and feature extraction. We show that these artefacts dramatically impact single-cell data analysis, obscuring meaningful biological interpretation.

In contrast, human experts identify cells in crowded environments using morphological, neighborhood, and intensity information. Here we describe a computational approach (Cell Spotter or {CSPOT}) that uses supervised machine learning in combination with classical segmentation to perform automated cell type calling. {CSPOT} is robust to artifacts that commonly afflict tissue imaging and can replace conventional gating.

	abstract = {In recent years, the language model Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}), which clusters co-occurring words into topics, has been widely appled in the computer vision field. However, many of these applications have difficulty with modeling the spatial and temporal structure among visual words, since {LDA} assumes that a document is a bag-of-words''. It is also critical to properly designwords'' and “documents” when using a language model to solve vision problems. In this paper, we propose a topic model Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({SLDA}), which better encodes spatial structure among visual words that are essential for solving many vision problems. The spatial information is not encoded in the value of visual words but in the design of documents. Instead of knowing the partition of words into documents {\textbackslash}textit\{a priori\}, the word-document assignment becomes a random hidden variable in {SLDA}. There is a generative procedure, where knowledge of spatial structure can be flexibly added as a prior, grouping visual words which are close in space into the same document. We use {SLDA} to discover objects from a collection of images, and show it achieves better performance than {LDA}.},

	abstract = {Tissue homeostasis and the emergence of disease are controlled by changes in the proportions of resident and recruited cells, their organization into cellular neighbourhoods, and their interactions with acellular tissue components. Highly multiplexed tissue profiling (spatial omics) makes it possible to study this microenvironment in situ, usually in 4-5 micron thick sections (the standard histopathology format). Microscopy-based tissue profiling is commonly performed at a resolution sufficient to determine cell types but not to detect subtle morphological features associated with cytoskeletal reorganisation, juxtracrine signalling, or membrane trafficking. Here we describe a high-resolution 3D imaging approach able to characterize a wide variety of organelles and structures at sub-micron scale while simultaneously quantifying millimetre-scale spatial features. This approach combines cyclic immunofluorescence ({CyCIF}) imaging of over 50 markers with confocal microscopy of archival human tissue thick enough (30-40 microns) to fully encompass two or more layers of intact cells. 3D imaging of entire cell volumes substantially improves the accuracy of cell phenotyping and allows cell proximity to be scored using plasma membrane apposition, not just nuclear position. In pre-invasive melanoma in situ, precise phenotyping shows that adjacent melanocytic cells are plastic in state and participate in tightly localised niches of interferon signalling near sites of initial invasion into the underlying dermis. In this and metastatic melanoma, mature and precursor T cells engage in an unexpectedly diverse array of juxtracrine and membrane-membrane interactions as well as looser neighbourhood associations whose morphologies reveal functional states. These data provide new insight into the transitions occurring during early tumour formation and immunoediting and demonstrate the potential for phenotyping of tissues at a level of detail previously restricted to cultured cells and organoids.},

	abstract = {Cutaneous melanoma is a highly immunogenic malignancy that is surgically curable at early stages but life-threatening when metastatic. Here we integrate high-plex imaging, 3D high-resolution microscopy, and spatially resolved microregion transcriptomics to study immune evasion and immunoediting in primary melanoma. We find that recurrent cellular neighborhoods involving tumor, immune, and stromal cells change significantly along a progression axis involving precursor states, melanoma in situ, and invasive tumor. Hallmarks of immunosuppression are already detectable in precursor regions. When tumors become locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted suppressive environment forms along the tumor–stromal boundary. This environment is established by cytokine gradients that promote expression of {MHC}-{II} and {IDO}1, and by {PD}1–{PDL}1-mediated cell contacts involving macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells. A few millimeters away, cytotoxic T cells synapse with melanoma cells in fields of tumor regression. Thus, invasion and immunoediting can coexist within a few millimeters of each other in a single specimen.The reorganization of the tumor ecosystem in primary melanoma is an excellent setting in which to study immunoediting and immune evasion. Guided by classic histopathology, spatial profiling of proteins and {mRNA} reveals recurrent morphologic and molecular features of tumor evolution that involve localized paracrine cytokine signaling and direct cell–cell contact.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1397},

	abstract = {Lymphocytes are key for immune surveillance of tumors, but our understanding of the spatial organization and physical interactions that facilitate lymphocyte anti-cancer functions is limited. We used multiplexed imaging, quantitative spatial analysis, and machine learning to create high-definition maps of lung tumors from a Kras/Trp53-mutant mouse model and human resections. Networks of interacting lymphocytes ("lymphonets") emerged as a distinctive feature of the anti-cancer immune response. Lymphonets nucleated from small T cell clusters and incorporated B cells with increasing size. {CXCR}3-mediated trafficking modulated lymphonet size and number, but T cell antigen expression directed intratumoral localization. Lymphonets preferentially harbored {TCF}1+ {PD}-1+ progenitor {CD}8+ T cells involved in responses to immune checkpoint blockade ({ICB}) therapy. Upon treatment of mice with {ICB} or an antigen-targeted vaccine, lymphonets retained progenitor and gained cytotoxic {CD}8+ T cell populations, likely via progenitor differentiation. These data show that lymphonets create a spatial environment supportive of {CD}8+ T cell anti-tumor responses.},
